Hi, I’m Nicholas Hart. I’m currently a student at Roger Williams University double majoring in Computer Science and Cybersecurity and Networking and minoring in Mathematics. Technology has always been a hobby and love of mine since I was a kid building my own desktop computer and always helping my family out with different technical support problems. I have always had a fascination for how something as simple as a Boolean electrical signal can be built into the technology we see today. Other activities I enjoy include playing hockey for the Roger Williams Hawks, snow/water skiing, dirt biking, and staying healthy. 
(show above :point_up:).
I am creating this blog as a place to post answer random Cybersecurity questions I have and to post some CTF writeups.
